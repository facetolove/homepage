    "aboutDesc1": "By the call and inspiration of God, we established the “Face to Love Kingdom Art and Culture Promotion Association” on August 29, 2021. We firmly believe that music, visuals, drama, and various forms of creativity are beautiful tools to share God’s love. Through the mission of worship music and evangelism, we aim to break through the four walls of the church and bring God’s love to those in need.",
    "aboutDesc2": "Since the debut of our music creations in 2019, we have produced numerous works and released albums. After the establishment of the association, we began collaborating with producers and musicians in the United States. This includes singles such as Face to You and The God of Our Fathers, as well as the album 起行, which is available on major music platforms. Looking ahead, we hope to collaborate with creators from diverse nations and cultures to demonstrate love and creativity that transcend language and boundaries.",
    "aboutDesc3": "The core mission of Face to Love is to reveal the true meaning of love—God Himself—through this evangelistic platform. In these turbulent and uncertain times, we hold fast to the belief: “Tell the Stories, and Be the Stories,” bearing a beautiful testimony to the salvation of our Lord Jesus Christ.",
